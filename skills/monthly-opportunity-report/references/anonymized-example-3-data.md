| **Roll-Up Metrics** | Quick stats on performance | +3% MoM, +14% YoY |
| **Other 1** | Any other business / Comments | Little to no pipeline for H1. Creating lots of pipeline for H2. Bigger accounts like PTC, Northwind & Candescent were taken away from the territory, leaving smaller accounts with little/none executive relationships developed. We created 90% of the pipeline after Aug 2025 for ADS. |
| **Other 2** | Any other business / Comments | No Pipeline for H1: Now we are creating pipeline for H2, we have the chance to move in (to Nov/Dec) 2-3 milestones from Trey Research and Adventure Works, this has not been yet confirmed by the customer. Will confirm by next month. Most of the pipeline for this territory last FY was AI pipeline in my solution area which included AI (now it does not). |
