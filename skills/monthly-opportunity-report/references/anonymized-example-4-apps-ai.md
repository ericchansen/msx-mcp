## Portfolio Summary

| Field | Description | Input / Insight |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Coverage** | Accounts covered | Contoso, Zava |
| **Top 3 Highlights** | Key wins or movements | Zava – connecting on their next-gen architecture "Project Aurora". Still in early phases, but have potential to influence their direction. Unfortunately, part of what Project Aurora is intended to deliver is Google parity. Contoso – well-positioned for continued success. Prod workloads were built in December because of capacity ahead of their March go-live. Still some concerns about readiness. Going to attend their DR/Go-Live plan at end of January and meet with key stakeholders to ensure we're keeping them comfortable. Also expanding reach into corporate workloads which should hopefully be able to land this fiscal. A. Datum – I have been able to connect with one of their engineering directors and this has led to us getting positive momentum with their plans to move forward on AKS. We expect to start seeing some AKS growth this quarter. |
| **Roll-Up Metrics** | Quick stats on performance | Total ACR Attainment YTD: 103%; Apps & AI attainment 101% (Contoso helped with this turnaround, taking our Apps # to 100% from 95%) |
| **Other 1** | Any other business / Comments | In the Digital & App Innovation hierarchy, qualified pipeline has increased. Some is opportunistic based on GitHub for Consolidated Messenger, but if pipeline lands, outlook is good that Apps & AI will be above 100% for this patch. I still have a lot of work to be done in SDP09.UM.ACC.12 though because even landing above 100% everywhere else, we are looking at landing in the mid-80s in that particular team. |

## Contribution / Impact Summary

| Customer | Engagement Type | Contribution w/ Impact |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Humongous Insurance | Discovery Calls | Led a session discovering their plans for MCP and gaining an understanding of how Microsoft can help them. |
| Southridge Video | POC/Business Conversations | Helped Taylor with a POC of App Service for their application. Unfortunately, because of their unwillingness to make changes with the app code, we're unable to support it. We were able to rapidly determine that and pivot to a business-forward case of migrating their app to VMs and to position a MACC there as a mutual benefit while we wait for them to evolve the architecture. |
| Internal | OpenAIWorkshop Contributor | Working with Kevin Tran, Rachel Adams, Meera Shah, and Anil Kumar. I have been supporting from the DevOps practices side of things to make this project more adoptable. I've recently coauthored the Infrastructure as Code pipelines with James and I'm working on bringing this as its own secondary workshop. |
| Internal | Apps Guild Team Lead w/ David Wright | Help organize and lead the biweekly app inno session. Pulled in Chris Lin to talk Spec Driven Development to ~50 app SEs across multiple OUs. |
